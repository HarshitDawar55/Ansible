# Important Points About this Playbook!
* This playbook uses some variables like accessKey & SecretKey which are requied for authentication in AWS, & those variables are been imported from another file. Therefore create your own YAML file for the variabels, add the requried information in it, & then update the name of that file in the playbook, & finally run it.
