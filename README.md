:sparkles::fireworks::tada: Important points about this Repository!!!!! :tada::fireworks::sparkles:

- This Repository will act as a complete Guide for Ansible, explaining each concept of Ansible with their practical code scripts written in YAML Language!

- For brief introduction of Ansible please refer to the section given below!

# What is Ansible?

- It is an **Automation Tool** & also the best automation tool available in the market.

- It is the most demanding tool in the market right now.

- It is used for **configuration management**.
  * To explain its use in detail, consider an environment in which we have machine of heterogenous system (OS) installed in them, to configure them manually i.e. to install some packages, or to perform some changes in the system manually is not possible practically, if we have a very large set-up (practical scenario in most of the companies). 

  * Therefore to perform configuration automatically, Ansible is required. Although there are other competitors of Ansible in the market like Puppet & Chef, but Ansible is more powerful and mature product.

  * Ansible works on different mechanism i.e. **Push Mechanism** while Puppet & Chef works on **Pull Mechanism** which has multiple advantages for Ansbile.

  * It is a **Agentless tool**.
  
  * It supports **Ad-hoc commands & Script(Playbooks)**.
